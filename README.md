# 🧠 Verilog Projects – From Basics to Advanced 🚀

Welcome to my curated collection of **Verilog HDL projects**, written from scratch as part of my learning and application journey in digital design. This repository includes a range of designs — from **fundamental gates and flip-flops** to **advanced modules like ALUs, FSMs, and TRNGs** — all written in clean, modular Verilog.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repo is a growing collection of Verilog designs I built as an undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I started with the basics and gradually progressed toward more complex digital systems, learning and applying concepts like:

- Structural vs behavioral modeling  
- Combinational & sequential circuits  
- Timing analysis  
- Finite state machines (FSM)  
- Pipelined designs  
- Testbenches and waveform verification  

## 💻 Simulation Tools Used

- **Vivado** – for synthesis and implementation on FPGA (XC7S50)  and for simulation and waveform analysis  

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- ✅ Build strong intuition in digital design using Verilog  
- ✅ Understand hardware behavior at the RTL level  
- ✅ Gain confidence in writing reusable and testable Verilog modules  
- ✅ Practice modular design and hierarchical hardware systems
